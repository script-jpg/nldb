# About
Natural Language Database (NLDB) is an extension of natural language processing applied to databases. The goal is to provide a text editor platform like Obsidian where users can create and save notes with unstructured data. Then, users can query their notes for information like ("What did I do last friday?") or ("What is my average number of steps taken over the last 10 days") and an agent will answer your questions based on the information in your notes.

# Why
I wanted to log information about myself (e.g. distance ran, exercise, plan, tasks completed) and get information out of it in a useful way. Usually, I just log my information and then I have to figure things out manually by looking at old notes. This should accelerate this process and make it much easier to make good use of past information. Additionally, I no longer need to fuss about the format that data is saved like adding and deleting columns to table or writing complex queries to get data I need.
